DarkHeart57: Who wants to do more*

[40Cdo] Aspery: Okay, well thank you for the honesty but I have to disagree since I started out as a recruit and had to work my way up to where I am now, it doesnt happen overnight and its not an american unit where ranks are handed out for spelling your name correctly. The opportunities are there you just have to take them, not attending your training is a good way of getting recognition too, all be it the wrong type. Additionally for your future unit endevours I'd suggested informing a member of the unit you are leaving rather than a member having to chase you down. Nevertheless I hope you enjoyed your short stay in the unit, and feel free to come on and chat with anyone.

19:21 - DarkHeart57: It just wasn't enjoyable honestly, and it did nothing for me. I just didn't connect with anything well enough to actually bother making an effort towards it

19:25 - [40Cdo] Aspery: Ah well, we find this happens a lot, I've found through my 4 years of ArmA, the majority of people that want to be in a unit, don't actually know what "Mil-Sim" is. The majority of them just want Tactical Gameplay. And thats fair enough, but basic etiquette is to inform the people that have no obligation to be there providing training and whatnot for you that you don't want to be a part of that group anymore.</p></body></html>
