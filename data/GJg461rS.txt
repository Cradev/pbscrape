<html><body><p>Thanks for the quick reply! 

Here are the basic illustrations, I created these when I started playing the character, since then some of the armor etc has changed. The stat for strength should be 18 in the character sheet.

General background: Half elf, 93 years old. In these early illustrations I wanted him to seem more human than elvish and carry some hint to his isolated upbringing in the forests trough his thick brows and long hair, and to give a hint of his beastmastery with a slight animalistic beard. Slender and tall like an elf with roughly 72kg`s (158 pounds) weight and 187 cm(6feet 1) tall. He is now cursed with Lykantrophy and is a werebear, the only change this makes is in his muscle and his strength is increased to 18 as well as more hair along his back, so feel free to increase his weight. 

Here is what it says on werebear in the monster manual " In humanoid form, they are large, muscular, and covered in hair matching the color of their ursine form's fur." However I would not like him to look like bigfoot, so If we go to something more along the lines of Beorn from the Hobbit films that would also be appreciated. Fur color is brown. 

Gear: I would like to have him wield a bow of elvish appearance, a dwarven shield on his back, and a longsword in his belt. The only piece of armor i would like him to wear is something along the lines of the elven leather chest armor you see in the illustration. 

The bear: The bear is a brown bear of some size, reaches roughly to his elbow. She has suffered some firedamage in the first session, so if she could seem to have some burned marks on one side that would be excellent.  

I Apologize for the wall of text and I hope you don't feel too restricted with how to go about the illustrations. I hope you don't feel to restricted with all of these guidelines, take your liberties, it is after all your illustration of my character I am after! 

Looking forward to</p></body></html>
