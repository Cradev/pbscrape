1. Q - What is Mission Warp?
	A- Mission Warp is a glitch that allows us to Warp to certain jobs from the SafeHouse.

2. Q - How does this work?
	A - Its a side effect of a glitch called "Bottle Crash". this glitch overloads the games memory and causes it to Crash, but While its crashing you still have control of the game for a little while. If we Bottle crash then reload the area without Re-loading the file we can keep the side effects of it and manipulate it to activate flags.

2. Q - Will this help in a Speedrun?
	A - At this very moment we dont know because it takes a bit to set it up.

3. A - Heres a video of it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsqpH6PJ_Gg&amp;t=26s</p></body></html>
