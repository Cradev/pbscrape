<html><body><p>regen: you're not understanding this whole thing
regen: but it would be too abstract to explain everything to you
regen: and it's really fucked up
regen: you guys fucked up the time you confronted Llama
regen: You see how manipulative it was?
regen: You guys had hopes and dreams, like getting paid with credits or premium or vip or whatever
regen: and you guys wanted llama to hire a coder
regen: because he actually makes enough money to hire one
regen: but in the end
regen: the conclusion was no payment with credits/subscriptions and make to-do's
regen: I interpreted it as "fuck off and get back to work slaves"
regen: It's your thing to believe whatever he says
regen: I have seen the truth, I know the truth
regen: It's your thing to believe me or him
regen: But Llama turned the game around
regen: I tried to liberate you guys yesterday
regen: and gave you credits and tried to find out how tf give you guys premium
regen: I wanted to give you the things you deserve as staff
regen: But people were thinking "HEY HE'S BREAKING THE SERVERS... HE DESTROYS EVERY WORK DONE IN THE LAST 2 YEARS.!!!! REPORTTT AND BAN HIM!!!!"
regen: People were shittalking
regen: Now everyone is hating me

regen: If you don't wanna believe me, stay a slave
regen: I'm gonna create some servers with no bugs and stuff
regen: And plugins people want
regen: And hope for getting 2x 64 slots full
regen: But if everything works out fine
regen: This will be no problem
regen: I'm done
regen: bai bb
regen: hf as slave
regen: if something else happens, you can find my steamid in the ban history in sourcebans</p></body></html>
