August 17th 2000 (16th)

Living in another world to make a virtual reality amoungst you and other player's to build a life / story of your own

I have roleplayed as a sheriff in a corrupt town to make money in my own way and example of how I became like this is 

I have roleplayed a multitude of characters ranging from a homeless man to a corrupt judge making choices based on personal 
( a store robbery) 

I had walked in on duty that day and as I walked into the front I had seen a handgun pointed at me and ducked for cover, I had shot the man and killed him, with the money that was stolen I had "obtained" it for myself, 
and destroyed the camera and shot all of the survivors inside. Doing so had made me look like a hero, after a while I ended up being sentenced to death where I had escaped and washed upon the shore of Silver Lake County.

I feel as if the rules are fine but maybe show some more (work) or progression of how the rules are or more in-depth (but yet I enjoy them because it makes it realistic)

Wanting to come back to roleplay after being away so long and the community has some things that intrest me such as cars clothes customization ETC.

To be as intimidating as possible " GET DOWN ON THE GROUND THIS IS A ROBBERY NOW I HAVE THE GUN AND CAN KILL YOU AT ANY MOMENT!" NOW PUT ALL THE MONEY IN THE BAG AND YOU *yelling at the customer* COME HERE! NOW YOU ARE COMING WITH ME FOR MY SAFTEY AND YOURS
*Exits the store with a hostage*

I would say along the lines of 

Please dont kill me take what you want please let me be I dont have much and I dont want to die *whilst dropping keys on the ground* (and bookbag)| Robber: NOW LAY YOUR FACE IN THE GROUND FOR 5 MINUTES OR YOUR DEAD!
*complies with what the robber says!*

I would try to find the local hangout areas to meet people affiliate in their actions, become apart of their clique! And befriend the most feared people on the island
