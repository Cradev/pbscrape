IC Name: ??? Idk probably a random name generator thing
Name of Position: 1/16th
Age of the Character: Anime.

Wipe Plans: Pretend to be a precious, sweet newbie in need of help. Manipulate people into giving me free shit. Tell no one. Eventually pop out like Aizen or some shit and begin the Memes, leading a group of baddies or some shit. If someone finds out early I'll stop their clock. Maybe some Kira type shit.
