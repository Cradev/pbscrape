A solider never dies. A soldier's work is never over. A soldier never surrenders. But the third corpse to pop up in the general whereabouts of the torture table was just that- a corpse. Not a soldier of any kind. The dear victim has gone through quite the torture. But that was to be expected, stamina was in a soldier's arsenal, was it not? Without the gears spinning, the girl had been tied up, head to toe to the torture table. Chains ends popped up in each of the four corners of the room. On each, before, and even still now, was a wolf. It would appear as if the wolves were tied away from Ikusaba, then the chains let up for more room and they'd inch closer to her every minute, though excruciatingly slowly. From the tips of her fingers, right down to every vein and nerve.

The chill of a tundra-esque hailstorm outside had screamed, as a member of Fenrir fell. How appropriate, that such a person would fall to wolves. 

What's left now is, like before, just a torso of the victim remaining. However, the stomach seems to be exposed, with a rather large 'X' right under the ribcage. Perhaps a guideline to the key? Perhaps not. (Note: There is nothing there. I'm telling you to mutilate a mutilated corpse.) The puzzlebox remains unopened, and you don't have the time for murder mystery night. You must make a decision. Can't you feel it? That should be your run-or-die instinct panicking right about now. 

It's your move, dear victim. 

What do you do?</p></body></html>
