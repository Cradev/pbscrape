II. Granite rent in the US

USA is the biggest country in the game, and doesn't have enough military power to defend all its cores. So they usually rent their regions and french gov decided to invest 120 G in the rent of 6 regions for a month, to have a road to its last bonus : south dakota's granite.

Les Etats-Unis &eacute;tant le pays ayant le plus de r&eacute;gion cores, et n'ayant pas les moyens militaire de toutes les d&eacute;fendre, a pour habitude de louer ses r&eacute;gions.
Ainsi le gouvernement fran&ccedil;ais a d&eacute;cid&eacute; d'investir 120 Golds dans la location de 6 d'entre elles pour un mois, afin d'avoir une route jusqu'au dernier bonus manquant &agrave; la France : le granite du South Dakota.

So France will have all of its bonuses at 100 % and house's producers will be glad to see their production rising soon !



III. Spanish war

Spain managed to cut its border with Mexico, so France decided to involve in the conflict between Spain and US / Italy / Portugal, trying to open new front and divide help provided by venezuela and brozil to Spain.
But Spain received less help than expected due to the resumption of Balkan's war. They decided to focus on Portugal, making our trip boring, but at least french soldier were able to get TPM, and we helped good allies !

IV. Mentor Project

Mentor Project is a project led by Arkh and his friend destined to gov, and especially to the Ministry of Education?
The project will try to provide Mentors to new players.
They'll have to help their goldson and help them involving in the community.
For this, an amount of money will be allowed to fulfill young player's needs.
This project is actually discussed in Ministry of Education.

"With the rise of salaries, the selling of HQ5 for 5 frf by the state doesn't offset their production cost. If you wanna help the state, go work for Agamemnon ;) (and if you are crazier, ask him to down your salary)." ShibO.</p></body></html>
