Dear. Chris,
I write to apply for the Technical Team Leader or Lead Developer. I am an excellent fit for this position, as demonstrated by my extensive background in coding and managing a Development team.
In my previous role, I haven't had much experience in owning a Company but when it comes to coding or taking charge in any situation, That is what I am good at. Or even my determination with anything I do.
I believe that I possess the temperament and experience to excel in this position. Because of my experience with coding, Coding has taught me that there isn't always someone that can help you with your problems, You have to problem solve on your own. Right now I only code in Bukkit API but I'm looking to expand my knowledge base, Like Python, Java, And C++.

When it come to me being mature, I am not perfect, and I make mistakes, But I act older then my age, I like to have fun but when I come to work, I buckle down and do my task.

I don't want to give you my life story but I am going to tell you why I would like this position. Since I was little I have always been looked down on by everyone because of stuff that my dad did/does. Most people think I won't succeed because of choices that the people around me have made.  But my Uncle, He works for the Pentagon, And he sees something in me, He knows I will go far in life, And he is my Roll Model.
I look forward to hearing from you about the progress of my application. If you have any further questions, please contact me using the above information. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, 
Logan Ford</p></body></html>
