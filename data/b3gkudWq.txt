&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches his hands out, moving the drapes out the way.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the window latches, grabbing them and unlatching them.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches down to the window ledge, grabbing onto it, and pushes upward.
&#9733; A cool breeze could be felt blowing into the room as the window is opened.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the drapes, moving them in front of the window, to block any sight into the room.
&#9733; Xiang Zu places his duffle bag on the table, filled with all the goodies need to do the preparation-
&#9733; Xiang Zu - and cooking.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the bag, unzipping it, and reaches in, beginning to take out several Matchbook -
&#9733; Xiang Zu - Boxes.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches into the bag, taking out a pair of sharp scissors.
&#9733; Xiang Zu begins to grab a match box, and runs scissors along the striking strip, cutting them off.
&#9733; After a awhile, there would be a large pile of cut striker strips laying upon the counter.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches under the sink counter, grabbing a large 20 liter plastic bucket.
&#9733; Xiang Zu places it ontop of the counter, and grabs a power drill from the duffle bag.
&#9733; Xiang Zu begins to adjust the power drill to proper settings, and then grabs a ruler from the bag.
&#9733; Xiang Zu begins to measure, taking out a marker and drawing a 3/4 hole in the bucket cover.
&#9733; Xiang Zu places away the marker and tape in the bag.
&#9733; Xiang Zu lifts up the drill, and places it on the previously-created mark and drills into it.
&#9733; A perfect 3/4 hole would be drilled into the cover of the bucket.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the bag, taking out a stir-bar and inserts into the hole, then places the stir-
&#9733; Xiang Zu -bar on the drill, attaching it and removing the drill-bit.
&#9733; Xiang Zu moves over to the counter, grabbing the large amount of striker strips, pouring into the bucket
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches into the duffle bag, taking out a container of acetone
&#9733; Xiang Zu opens the cap of the acetone, and begins to pour it in the bucket with the striker strips.
&#9733; He continues to fill the bucket, until it hits the 5.5 literline of the bucket      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu places the cap back on the acetone container, twisting it till' its closed.
&#9733; Xiang Zu grabs the drill, and squeezes the trigger, as it begins to mix the contents of the bucket.
&#9733; The mixer would continue to ago about five minutes.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu de-taches the stir bar from the drill, placing it into the duffle bag.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the cover, taking out the stir bar, and takes the cover.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches into the bag, taking out filters, and begins to cover the sink with them.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches into the bag, taking out tape and begins to tape down the filters along the edges.
&#9733; Xiang Zu grabs the bucket, pouring it into the sink.
&#9733; There would be large amounts of red powder left behind on the filters.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu goes inside the bag, taking out a large jar and a scooper, begining to scoop all the powder 
&#9733; Xiang Zu -into the plastic jar, then placing it on the counter.
&#9733; Xiang Zu untapes the filters from around the edges, picking them up and balling them up.
&#9733; Xiang Zu turns around, aiming at the trash-can throwing it towards it.
((OOC Luck)) Xiang Zu tries his luck from 1 to 100 and gets 30.
((OOC Chance at 30%)) Xiang Zu's attempt has succeeded.
&#9733; The ball of garbage filters lands perfectly into the garbage can.      ((Xiang Zu))
 [Chinese] Xiang Zu says: Fuck yeah.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches into the bag, taking out multiple boxes of pills that contain Ephredrine.
&#9733; Xiang Zu begins to open every box, popping out all the pills and placing them on the counter.
&#9733; The process would continue for some time, until plentiful of pills lay upon the counter.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches into the bag, taking out a large pill crusher, and then opens the top
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches his arm to the counter, sweeping all the pills into the crusher.
&#9733; Xiang Zu closes the top, and begins to crush up the pills.
&#9733; It makes a audible crunching noise, as all the pills are turnt into white powder after some-      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; - time of crushing.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches into the bag, taking out  another jar, and pours the powder into the jar,
&#9733; The white powder blumps in, sending some dust around.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches into the counter, taking out a large round-bottom flask.
&#9733; Xiang Zu takes out a bunsen burner from the counter also, placing it on the counter, connecting it -
&#9733; Xiang Zu - to a small tank of gas.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the tank, twisting the valve, and then flicking the switch on the burner to ignit
&#9733; The gas tank makes a loud hissing noise, then the bunsen burner flicks, making fire.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu places the round bottom flask above the fire, letting it heat.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the jar of crushed pills, pouring about 150 grams of Ephedrine into it.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the bar of Red Phosphurs, pouring about 40 grams into it.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches into the bag, taking out Hydroiodic Acid, pouring about 340mL into it.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the chemistry kit, taking out a condenser and attaching it to the top of the flas
&#9733; Xiang Zu walks away, letting the solution worl
&#9733; The solution continues to mix and heat, yielding to high octane numbers.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; A few hours past.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu comes back, turning off the bunsen burner, and de-taching the condenser.
&#9733; Xiang Zu walks to the sink, pouring about a equal amount of water, and pouring it into the flask.
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the kit, taking out another flask, and attaches a filter to it.
&#9733; Xiang Zu begins to pour the flask into the other flask, the Phorphpus being left behind, and the -
&#9733; Xiang Zu -solution going into it.
&#9733; Xiang Zu pours the solution onto a large tray, and then grabs a strong-lye solution from the bag,.
&#9733; Xiang Zu begins to pour the solution onto the solution left behind on the tray.
&#9733; After awhile the solution would begin to harden and crystalize.      ((Xiang Zu))
&#9733; Xiang Zu reaches to the tray, beginning to smash it up and break it up, meth crystals left behind.</p></body></html>
