<html><body><p>The answer is that they would be just like the Q&amp;As with Griesbach and O'Donnell. 

Which means that even though we disagree with them or think they are the scum of the earth, we'd treat them with the absolute most respect. We can be trollish, but we know when it's time to throw on our grown-up pants. I love that about this sub.

There were times during our AMAs when things seemed a little unpredictable. For example, Griesbach took quite a while to answer our questions, to the point where we were panicking in mod chat. In the end he didn't answer any follow-ups, yet not a single person complained. I gather that this was because we went into it knowing that he's a busy guy who doesn't owe us anything. 

O'Donnell came across as *pretty* rusty about the case details (example: coins on cabinet). Yet rather than reply to him with snark and sarcasm and tell him to "come back when he reads CASO", we did our best to politely explain to him that he was misinformed and enlighten him to the truther party line. 

You may be thinking, "Well, if we're all so well behaved then why are our AMAs so heavily moderated! Chat filters up the ass...approved submitters? Wtf!" 

Just kidding. We know you're not thinking that because the answer couldn't be more obvious: We have to babysit truthers.*

I just read the following over on TTM:

&gt;It&rsquo;s just bad form to throw people&rsquo;s words back in their faces, unless those words are extremely on point, which I don&rsquo;t think they are, in this case (the MG situation continued to deteriorate).This is the kind of thing I would expect to see on SAIG

It's funny, because we're constantly accused of being so LOUD and obnoxious, yet our AMA guests were harassed by truthers via PM and Twitter, threatened, and mocked. Griesbach was/is accused of being NYJ. I had a truther following me around Reddit as I promoted his AMA, telling people they shouldn't attend and should go read TTM instead. I can't imagine a single guilter doing that. On the day of the O'Donnell AMA Hos stickied an "official debunking" thread before the AMA even started, then gloated when Dan blocked him on Twitter for spamming him. Can you picture any SAIG mod doing that? Not a chance in hell. But yeah, we're *totally* the obnoxious ones.

We've been told that we don't have open minds. If that were true we wouldn't allow truthers to post here and attend our AMAs. JLWhitaker made a comment that we've banned many truthers, but that isn't true. There are only 8 regular users banned. In addition, we've done away with shadow bans, opting instead to put people on a moderator approval list. There are only 3 regular posters on that list. If Hos ever releases his ban list we'll go ahead and release ours too. That would make for a good laugh.

The myth that we aren't open to being challenged is about as ridiculous as GZ's dog being the murderer. /u/H00plehead is even known to PM people and invite them to come discuss things over here. Discussion is embraced and encouraged!

We're blamed for a lot of stuff, aren't we? Like shutting down /r/MaM and harassing ~~/u/Needlessly_Long~~ /u/needless_things to the point where he deleted his account. When an admin let them know that she didn't think it was someone from SAIG, there was no announcement apologizing to guilters. That "fact" gets to live on in truther lore.

If Buting or Ferak showed up unannounced and started conversing with us, we'd welcome them with open arms. We'd act like adults and disagree with them in a respectful way. Mods would let the subscribers determine whether or not to engage with them, what they talk about, and how long it lasts, only intervening when it's obvious someone can't keep their cool. That's the way it should be. I've never seen a more insecure group of people than the mods over at TTM, locking threads for seemingly no reason, then stickying their own posts basically telling people to get over it. The fear is real. It's hilarious.

Perhaps /u/twistsandturnssa would like to keep the Q&amp;A going over here? If so, we'll be more than happy to host it! We'll leave it open to everyone but those on our ban list and only moderate those who are unnecessarily rude and not interested in discussion. 

If so, give us a shout. :)

After the last few days, I think a big thank you to guilters is needed. So thank you guys for being so awesome.
