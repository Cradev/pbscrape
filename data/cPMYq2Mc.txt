<html><body><p>Before I knew it the colours of you were painted across (the sky?)
I want to send these words over to you
Forever these (lack of) understanding illogically continues
Until this time comes
Perhaps it will balance with you
These insecure times may occasionally go by but
Sorry for always causing you problems
Ahh,  I love you I love you I love you, I want to convey these to you</p></body></html>
