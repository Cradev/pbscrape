[4:53:30 AM] Lyveriana: LITERALLY WHAT
[4:53:34 AM] Lyveriana: NOOOOOOOOO
[4:53:45 AM] drone91: Same
[4:53:52 AM] drone91: there'll be a diary tomorrow, when Burmy learns
[4:54:01 AM] Lyveriana: Anora
[4:54:04 AM] Lyveriana: Shes heard
[4:54:09 AM] Lyveriana: But shes not
[4:54:19 AM] Lyveriana: She cant tell Cauri
[4:54:34 AM] Lyveriana: Can I PLEASE have a sending over?
[4:56:36 AM] Lyveriana: Oh my GOD
[4:58:20 AM] Lyveriana: ACTUALLY NO
[4:58:23 AM] Lyveriana: Anora
[4:58:32 AM] Lyveriana: Will come to Burmice
[4:58:38 AM] drone91: Sending?
[4:58:41 AM] Lyveriana: No
[4:58:52 AM] drone91: Burmy doens't know yet
[4:58:54 AM] Lyveriana: Just over there at night when Cauri sleeps.
[4:58:54 AM] drone91: they're just
[4:59:01 AM] drone91: leaving the celebration
[4:59:02 AM] drone91: but tomorro
[4:59:06 AM] drone91: w
[4:59:07 AM] Lyveriana: Anora KNOWS
[4:59:15 AM] Lyveriana: Because of the lorestone
[4:59:19 AM] drone91: the city will be full of it
[4:59:22 AM] drone91: yeah
[4:59:31 AM] Lyveriana: Sending yes
[4:59:58 AM] Lyveriana: "B-BURMICE?!" Anora's voice sounds shredded to say the LEAST, that one name barely made out
[5:00:07 AM] drone91: well
[5:00:16 AM] drone91: I havent't slept yet because of Tanatia and the reverie
[5:00:24 AM] Lyveriana: Oh
[5:00:37 AM] drone91: Tomorrow, k?
[5:00:41 AM] drone91: Or..well
[5:02:04 AM] Lyveriana: Oh and basically
[5:02:19 AM] Lyveriana: You will have to give me ALL the info you can give
[5:02:20 AM] Lyveriana: On
[5:02:23 AM] Lyveriana: Well
[5:02:29 AM] drone91: Wel
[5:02:36 AM] Lyveriana: Burmice's scemes. As far as Maddie knows
[5:02:44 AM] Lyveriana: Because lorestone
[5:02:44 AM] drone91: All the info they've talked about
[5:02:49 AM] Lyveriana: Yeah
[5:04:00 AM] drone91: Know what?
[5:04:08 AM] drone91: hmm
[5:04:17 AM] drone91: if the time fits, I might even respond now
[5:04:36 AM] drone91: Burmy returning from the reverie..well. It makes it perhaps an interesting time to leanr of it
[5:04:54 AM] Lyveriana: Sure
[5:05:36 AM] Lyveriana: Though... Should she come -home- Anora is... Sitting there knees pulled up crying hysterically
[5:05:48 AM] drone91: Who should come home
[5:05:54 AM] Lyveriana: Burmy
[5:06:07 AM] drone91: Wait, Anora is at her home? How did she enter
[5:06:13 AM] Lyveriana: In FROMT
[5:06:17 AM] Lyveriana: Front
[5:06:22 AM] drone91: Sorry
[5:06:30 AM] drone91: I've woke up literally 23 hours ago
[5:06:55 AM] Lyveriana: Is fine
[5:07:14 AM] drone91: But yeah
[5:07:31 AM] drone91: Hjorr was mentioning earlier that he almost hopes it'll fail
[5:07:41 AM] drone91: because it'd make for a nice final point
[5:07:46 AM] drone91: I didn't quite guess this final
[5:07:56 AM] Lyveriana: Hmm
[5:08:03 AM] drone91: We talked in the morning and basically... eh. He was wondering about slight retcons
[5:08:07 AM] Lyveriana: But if you want to you can respond
[5:08:14 AM] drone91: which... didn't work with me because, well.
[5:08:38 AM] drone91: Burmy's motivations ATM are entirely based on what she perceived happened ,and there's four-five things that together made an (accidental) picture
[5:09:01 AM] drone91: and he sort of went that bleh, his OOC absence has damaged things irretrievably, time to fuck off and start anew or some
[5:09:25 AM] Lyveriana: Hmh
[5:09:26 AM] Lyveriana: But yes
[5:09:31 AM] Lyveriana: I
[5:09:31 AM] Lyveriana: Anora
[5:09:45 AM] Lyveriana: She needs to either be in the-
[5:09:50 AM] Lyveriana: Uuuughhhh
[5:10:49 AM] drone91: well
[5:10:50 AM] drone91: hmm
[5:11:02 AM] drone91: Perhaps in the morning like
[5:11:23 AM] drone91: we keep off-game until the scene happens?
[5:11:26 AM] drone91: honestly
[5:11:35 AM] drone91: it'll take a /while/ to get you info
[5:11:40 AM] drone91: and there's infor I don't have
[5:11:45 AM] drone91: and that I chat-askd Hjorr for
[5:12:40 AM] Lyveriana: Uh
[5:12:42 AM] Lyveriana: Yeah
[5:12:42 AM] Lyveriana: or
[5:12:44 AM] Lyveriana: can we wait a mometn
[5:12:51 AM] Lyveriana: Becaues Anora is going to probably pop about the Mask
[5:12:53 AM] Lyveriana: And literally
[5:12:57 AM] Lyveriana: Be baweling her eyes out
[5:13:14 AM] drone91: But you know, Burmy went home, probably
[5:13:26 AM] Lyveriana: Myes
[5:13:29 AM] drone91: she threw Tanatia to Greycastle's place then Alena to her home
[5:13:35 AM] drone91: then either walked across the street or teleported
[5:13:39 AM] Lyveriana: ...But
[5:13:39 AM] Lyveriana: fuck
[5:14:04 AM] Lyveriana: I coul dhave her enter the Mask -first-
[5:17:19 AM] Lyveriana: Anora probably won't act on having all the info yet, by the way
[5:17:28 AM] Lyveriana: ..of course she wont
[5:17:31 AM] Lyveriana: she has more things to
[5:17:32 AM] Lyveriana: you know
[5:18:26 AM] drone91: yyep
[5:18:40 AM] Lyveriana: Fuck it
[5:19:17 AM] drone91: Heh. Worst case scenario. Burmy  offs Anora, Cauri offs Burmy (or vice versa), Tanatia is set out alone, probably offed by Thia soon ... the whole birdflock goes to hell
[5:20:18 AM] Lyveriana: Why would
[5:20:21 AM] Lyveriana: Burmy off Anora
[5:21:23 AM] drone91: If she realizes Anora knows everything... I'm not sure she /would/ but she could conceive of it.
[5:21:40 AM] Lyveriana: Anora won't -say- though
[5:21:41 AM] Lyveriana: not yet
[5:21:55 AM] drone91: Because... uh
[5:22:10 AM] drone91: There's ... schemes. Some never described as carried out
[5:22:16 AM] drone91: some clearly /not/ carried out
[5:22:21 AM] drone91: some barely hatched
[5:22:27 AM] drone91: One thing Anora knows for instance
[5:22:39 AM] Lyveriana: Mhm
[5:23:32 AM] drone91: The Shrouded Ones Burmy brought to strengthen the militia in Southwharf are absurdly powerful re-engineered Thayan undead... something that can go toe to toe with devils ,and their second purpose was the possibility of an all out war in the streets with the Black Dragons
[5:23:36 AM] drone91: if it ever came to it
[5:23:51 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[5:24:01 AM] drone91: She'd also know... all the two have learned about Cauri
[5:24:21 AM] drone91: Including Burmy's only lately "if you really think so" slightly wavering belief she's a double agent
[5:24:31 AM] drone91: and the reasons for her conviction
[5:24:48 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[5:25:14 AM] drone91: Also that Maddie and Burmy decided Will has to be stopped, especially his minions do
[5:25:19 AM] drone91: and of the letter
[5:25:25 AM] drone91: that implicates /her/ too
[5:26:02 AM] drone91: and.. .gods
[5:26:05 AM] drone91: there's so much more
[5:26:16 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[5:26:24 AM] Lyveriana: and Anora will get to know all
[5:26:26 AM] Lyveriana: But
[5:26:26 AM] Lyveriana: for now
[5:26:42 AM] drone91: Jha being Burmy's agent tasked with sht, too
[5:26:51 AM] drone91: including how she was sent to Anora's and Cauri's home
[5:27:30 AM] Lyveriana: OH yeah
[5:27:33 AM] Lyveriana: Anora -wil- be furious
[5:27:36 AM] Lyveriana: FURIOUS
[5:27:40 AM] Lyveriana: BUUUT not yet
[5:28:19 AM] drone91: Burmy will just be sad
[5:28:40 AM] drone91: I can imagine her picking the diary up again. .. and I think there will be a couple teardrops on it.  Simply because...
[5:29:04 AM] Lyveriana: Anora will have
[5:29:13 AM] Lyveriana: one few hours to completely lose herself
[5:29:14 AM] drone91: It turned sad. On the brink of victory, she... inexplicably dumped her, then suffered a colossal defeat. I mean... what happened at court wll likely circulate
[5:29:18 AM] Lyveriana: And then it's back to 24/8 hiding
[5:29:29 AM] drone91: still
[5:29:32 AM] drone91: when I wake up
[5:29:35 AM] drone91: do we go wit hthe sending or no
[5:29:46 AM] drone91: i'm fine with either
[5:30:05 AM] Lyveriana: Ah
[5:30:08 AM] Lyveriana: when you wake up, yes
[5:30:14 AM] Lyveriana: THEN that sendign hsa happened
[5:30:17 AM] drone91: ohshit
[5:30:25 AM] drone91: I have the entry in Burmy's diary
[5:30:32 AM] drone91: One last picture
[5:30:55 AM] drone91: Maddie ,drawn, lying down with her eyes closed, as realistically as she could be by Burmy's skill
[5:31:01 AM] drone91: And above her... star-filled sky
[5:31:06 AM] Lyveriana: Aw
[5:31:09 AM] drone91: and a little flying ostrich
[5:31:13 AM] drone91: soaring up above
[5:32:17 AM] drone91: flying off into the horizon
[5:32:43 AM] Lyveriana: ..Help
[5:32:44 AM] Lyveriana: No
[5:32:46 AM] Lyveriana: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXxTRnxmY-c
[5:34:39 AM] drone91: anyhow, off to catch at least four hours
[5:34:56 AM] Lyveriana: Kk
[7:47:46 AM] Lyveriana: Also
[7:47:46 AM] Lyveriana: uh
[7:47:49 AM] Lyveriana: Please ignore the sending for now
[7:47:53 AM] Lyveriana: for -now-
[7:47:59 AM] Lyveriana: Because it'll be less panicked.
[8:17:01 AM] drone91: morning
[8:19:26 AM] drone91: I must say that when Burmy called the Gravecall (originally) a sign of the times to come
[8:19:33 AM] drone91: She didn't quite mean it this way
[8:20:15 AM] Lyveriana: Heyhey
[8:25:12 AM] drone91: I noticed your huge post, imma read it
[8:25:53 AM] Lyveriana: eh
[8:25:54 AM] Lyveriana: yeah
[8:25:55 AM] Lyveriana: it's
[8:25:56 AM] Lyveriana: ..Yeah
[8:29:30 AM] drone91: 
"...I-if you'd die young.. I-I'd bury y-you i-in sa-satins...
L-lay y-you d-down o-on a.. bed of.. R-roses...
S-sink.. Y-you.. in..."
[8:29:37 AM] drone91: Is this the song I think it is
[8:29:48 AM] Lyveriana: If I die young, yes.
[8:29:50 AM] Lyveriana: And it's
[8:29:51 AM] Lyveriana: the most
[8:29:51 AM] Lyveriana: damn
[8:29:53 AM] Lyveriana: accurate thing
[8:29:53 AM] Lyveriana: ever
[8:30:00 AM] drone91: I think it is, gods. Now I have it playing through my head
[8:30:12 AM] Lyveriana: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQoFLrZ5C3M
[8:30:13 AM] drone91: because uh, i love it ever since i've been introduced to it.. back in 2011
[8:30:14 AM] Lyveriana: Have fun
[8:30:18 AM] Lyveriana: Anora will sing this version
[8:30:22 AM] Lyveriana: With a few bends and such
[8:30:23 AM] Lyveriana: But she will
[8:30:34 AM] Lyveriana: It's a slower version
[8:30:53 AM] drone91: in case I wasn't sad enough already x3
[8:31:33 AM] Lyveriana: ..yeah
[8:32:59 AM] Lyveriana: I can actually
[8:33:00 AM] Lyveriana: sing that song
[8:33:07 AM] Lyveriana: And I will record it and make my own version of it
[8:33:08 AM] Lyveriana: for this sake
[8:33:15 AM] drone91: yyep
[8:33:20 AM] drone91: I was about to suggest
[8:34:38 AM] drone91: also
[8:34:47 AM] drone91: when you look at the last written entry
[8:34:56 AM] drone91: It's just incredibly sad
[8:35:21 AM] drone91: 
Grandmother crushed Foultooth the Pit Fiend. Father defeated the self-declared heir of Aulmpiter. It's about time I joined the family business.
 

As I said to Hjorr yesterday, she joined the family business in a very different manner
[8:35:38 AM] Lyveriana: Yup
[8:36:32 AM] drone91: And Anora is kinda lucky. This is, like I said. News the city will be chock-full of today.
[8:36:36 AM] drone91: No need for an excuse even
[8:37:57 AM] drone91: It's the equivalent of say, Richard Sulik yelling at Juncker in the European Parliament , then getting stabbed to death in a disturbance he'd cause.
[8:38:13 AM] Lyveriana: It reminds me
[8:38:17 AM] Lyveriana: of Julius Caesar's death
[8:38:19 AM] drone91: in the sense of, it's harder to imagine /bigger/ news
[8:38:28 AM] drone91: heh
[8:38:32 AM] drone91: as we agreed in chat
[8:38:41 AM] drone91: she was likely stabbed by an irate member of her own faction
[8:38:47 AM] Lyveriana: Ow
[8:38:54 AM] drone91: who preferred a martyr to a failure... or perhaps was just angry
[8:39:19 AM] Lyveriana: Hmm
[8:39:28 AM] drone91: though the official version is "It'll likely never be known" because
[8:39:28 AM] drone91: mob
[8:39:46 AM] drone91: you can't hope to find the perp, even with necromancy and whatnot at hand
[8:39:53 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[8:40:12 AM] Lyveriana: I just feel -so- bad for Anora right now, because she has to stay holed up
[8:40:14 AM] Lyveriana: with
[8:40:18 AM] Lyveriana: Cauri
[8:40:19 AM] drone91: Cauri
[8:40:28 AM] drone91: Before I drop downstairs to eat
[8:40:29 AM] drone91: hm
[8:40:31 AM] Lyveriana: And throughout that whole harrowing, she still thought of her.
[8:41:04 AM] drone91: Thought. Would any sending have happened before now, or after  ? As in, whether I should bother coming in-game for now
[8:41:09 AM] drone91: until colleague is here
[8:41:24 AM] Lyveriana: NO sending has happened -before-
[8:41:33 AM] drone91: very well
[8:41:36 AM] Lyveriana: And after.. Yeah, probably so. Anor would however station a guard or somesuch
[8:41:37 AM] Lyveriana: to
[8:41:38 AM] Lyveriana: uh
[8:41:42 AM] Lyveriana: prevent Cauri from leaking
[8:41:54 AM] drone91: It..well.  I doubt Burmy..
[8:42:00 AM] Lyveriana: But it has happened after, like most likely accompnied with the blue message
[8:42:00 AM] drone91: wait what
[8:42:29 AM] drone91: I have a feeling Cauri would react odddly to eing guarded as a prisoner.
[8:42:44 AM] Lyveriana: ..Not in sight, duh
[8:42:48 AM] drone91: Anora is one thing... a guard is another
[8:43:08 AM] drone91: Eh. Cauri is still a bard though
[8:43:14 AM] Lyveriana: fair
[8:43:20 AM] Lyveriana: I'm just thinking out lodu here btw
[8:43:21 AM] drone91: Not in sight likely means you can't act quick enough
[8:43:24 AM] drone91: oh, I know
[8:43:29 AM] drone91: i'm doing the same and well
[8:43:34 AM] drone91: trying to obe helpful
[8:43:42 AM] Lyveriana: Yyup
[8:43:43 AM] Lyveriana: You are!
[8:44:23 AM] drone91: Also, I think I completely know what you mean about Alena, and like, I think I figured out. Most of the time my reaction is inside like 'Well, duh"
[8:44:43 AM] Lyveriana: Yeah
[8:44:59 AM] drone91: Like yesterday when she let it slip about knowing of Burmy's talks with the other half. 'Hah, now Burmy iis going to try to salvage it" 'Well, what do you think she's doing"
[8:45:05 AM] drone91: very loosely quoted
[8:45:26 AM] Lyveriana: Yup
[8:45:30 AM] Lyveriana: That'sjust an example
[8:45:32 AM] Lyveriana: And you know
[8:45:34 AM] Lyveriana: it's fine for a while
[8:45:38 AM] Lyveriana: But then after doign it so many times
[8:45:40 AM] Lyveriana: it just.. meh
[8:45:45 AM] drone91: eh  as I said
[8:45:53 AM] drone91: I don't really care particularly
[8:46:34 AM] Lyveriana: Hmm
[8:46:43 AM] Lyveriana: LIke
[8:46:48 AM] Lyveriana: it's really not neccesarily that she does it
[8:46:49 AM] Lyveriana: more like
[8:46:56 AM] Lyveriana: because it happens  so much
[8:47:00 AM] drone91: maybbe i'm just good at filtering extraneous text
[8:47:13 AM] drone91: also, can i just say you write awesomely
[8:47:25 AM] drone91: *is vaguely envious*
[8:47:33 AM] Lyveriana: It's.. Really nto so good
[8:47:36 AM] Lyveriana: And it's bloody early
[8:47:57 AM] drone91: Well, you know
[8:48:00 AM] drone91: veni, vidi , upvoti
[8:48:06 AM] Lyveriana: bwahaha
[8:48:10 AM] Lyveriana: Yes
[8:48:20 AM] Lyveriana: But. .Yeah. It took a long time to write
[8:48:24 AM] Lyveriana: But.. I think it turend out alright
[8:48:32 AM] Lyveriana: Especially the whole.. Slight references to Maddie
[8:48:46 AM] drone91: I made that up back when i was on the site
[8:48:52 AM] Lyveriana: -and- the silent screamy bit.  Reason I like that so much, and kept that so short is because Anora rarely shows her emotions
[8:48:58 AM] drone91: there upvotes (on wikidot platform) were a big thing
[8:49:00 AM] Lyveriana: So.. Now that she does it this openly, no words can convey
[8:49:05 AM] drone91: ...yeah
[8:51:07 AM] drone91: Oh, by extent. Anora would have learned the full extent of Burmy's eye story. She's the only one who heard it with all the trappings - Kain did recently, a very tl'dr version from a sleepless Burmy who couldn't be bothered to resist
[8:51:28 AM] Lyveriana: Ah
[8:51:39 AM] drone91: Because when Maddie was sort of broken over what they discussed, specifically Cauri
[8:51:44 AM] drone91: they actually hugged
[8:52:16 AM] drone91: and IIRC Maddie used the occassion to grab one of Burmy's hairs for potential later use as she caressed Burmy's head
[8:52:32 AM] Lyveriana: Aww
[8:52:34 AM] drone91: ((Burmy did repay the favour a couple meetings later, gathering a stray from the sofa)
[8:52:42 AM] Lyveriana: Also.
[8:52:47 AM] Lyveriana: Xd
[8:52:48 AM] Lyveriana: But
[8:52:55 AM] Lyveriana: If Burmice wer to off her
[8:53:11 AM] Lyveriana: Anora most likely would try. Very. Hard.
[8:53:25 AM] drone91: eh. It illustrates what Maddie was, perfectly
[8:53:30 AM] Lyveriana: ..But she's ot wshed up against Burmy
[8:53:43 AM] drone91: ?
[8:54:37 AM] Lyveriana: I mean
[8:54:39 AM] Lyveriana: Basically
[8:54:44 AM] Lyveriana: if Burmice would actively try and off Anora
[8:54:47 AM] Lyveriana: LIke, you know.
[8:55:10 AM] Lyveriana: She would mos tlikely -try- resisting, but, eh, no.
[8:55:33 AM] Lyveriana: The avantage she had witht he siege thing is that none of her direct foes wielded magic
[8:55:40 AM] Lyveriana: Because she is -not- as competent as a mage s Burmy is
[8:55:54 AM] drone91: yeah
[8:55:58 AM] drone91: To be fair
[8:56:13 AM] drone91: Burmy has a whole selection of spells that could kill her with a touch, or worse
[8:56:29 AM] Lyveriana: So, if she actively tried offing Anora
[8:56:36 AM] Lyveriana: ..Well, you don't have my obejction
[8:56:41 AM] drone91: I know
[8:57:07 AM] drone91: It's one of those things. What goes, goes. But..eh.
[8:57:40 AM] drone91: Burmy could /probably/ force herself to do it because uh, she's fighting for her life here and that comes first
[8:57:55 AM] Lyveriana: Yyep
[8:58:01 AM] Lyveriana: I just
[8:58:05 AM] Lyveriana: That would be very much poor Cauri
[8:58:17 AM] Lyveriana: I mean.. What goes, goes, but eyy.\
[8:58:21 AM] drone91: But uh. She'd be just stupidly upset about it
[8:58:37 AM] drone91: because by all right, she shouldn't care, not this much
[8:58:38 AM] Lyveriana: Anora would try talkign in on her
[8:58:59 AM] Lyveriana: LIke, she wouldn't actively raise a hand against the Drowess
[8:59:09 AM] Lyveriana: just. Defend herself should it needed, and.. Well
[8:59:16 AM] Lyveriana: Try talking
[9:00:07 AM] drone91: Burmy could too. The problem is... she doesn't see into Anora and has no guarantees any word to her is genuine
[9:00:20 AM] Lyveriana: Yyup
[9:00:22 AM] Lyveriana: This is true
[9:00:26 AM] Lyveriana: NOr can Anora garentee it
[9:00:27 AM] Lyveriana: or well
[9:00:41 AM] Lyveriana: She can, just.. nOt the inerpretation of those words.
[9:00:41 AM] drone91: yep. No living person cn
[9:00:43 AM] Lyveriana: Because, y'know
[9:00:45 AM] Lyveriana: hearing what you want
[9:00:59 AM] drone91: Not just that.. .but lying exists
[9:01:11 AM] drone91: Burmy is an impressive dissembler herself
[9:01:27 AM] drone91: and well. She might be bad at telling such things from cues and such, shit Sense Motive but
[9:01:34 AM] drone91: She isn't an idiot
[9:01:37 AM] Lyveriana: OH yeah
[9:01:40 AM] Lyveriana: Anora lies loads.
[9:03:22 AM] drone91: and it's like shit. Anora for all the troubles, has been one of the people propping Burmy up
[9:03:58 AM] drone91: mentally I mean
[9:04:08 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[9:04:10 AM] Lyveriana: And.. See
[9:04:18 AM] Lyveriana: Anoa has -so- much to use against Burmy now
[9:04:20 AM] Lyveriana: yet she's not doing it
[9:04:21 AM] Lyveriana: ..yet
[9:04:57 AM] Lyveriana: And she has proof too, I mean.. She still carries the lorestone along
[9:05:01 AM] drone91: yep
[9:05:13 AM] Lyveriana: ..And she's not handing hat to -anyone-.
[9:05:38 AM] Lyveriana: LIke
[9:05:40 AM] Lyveriana: She's not giving that thing away
[9:06:38 AM] drone91: Which is good. Burmy doesn't even know it exists
[9:06:53 AM] Lyveriana: ..Which is even better
[9:06:57 AM] drone91: And she wouldn't be able to read it if it did. As I joked to Hjorr
[9:07:04 AM] drone91: she barely fulfuls one of the ocnditions
[9:07:06 AM] Lyveriana: She's not handing it out to Cauri, either.
[9:07:13 AM] Lyveriana: Or letting her know it exists
[9:07:16 AM] drone91: Yeah like
[9:08:08 AM] drone91: Okay, I need food then I'll infodump a few more tidbits, although really Hjorr should be the one doign this
[9:08:16 AM] drone91: and then we do things
[9:09:41 AM] Lyveriana: ..Also, uh.. Hjorr said I needed to ask you so
[9:20:39 AM] drone91: and actually there is
[9:20:48 AM] drone91: Burmy knows how to geas.
[9:21:48 AM] drone91: Anora accepting one is like one of the few pleasant outs of this. Simply to keep all of Burmice's secrets to herself, until told otherwise by Burmy
[9:22:33 AM] drone91: It's one of the few spells that can manage.
[9:22:36 AM] Lyveriana: If Burmice gets to -know-
[9:22:41 AM] drone91: yep
[9:22:44 AM] drone91: as I'm saying
[9:22:50 AM] drone91: one of the few pleasant outs
[9:22:57 AM] drone91: her not knowing is another such
[9:23:00 AM] drone91: pleasant for Anora I mean
[9:23:43 AM] drone91: Because, eh. I think Burmy would be able to bullshit herself with how Anora's death would cause so much trouble
[9:23:51 AM] drone91: and well. A geas is super hard to lift
[9:23:58 AM] drone91: limited wish, wish or miracle
[9:24:43 AM] drone91: maybe I'm thinking too far ahead with this, you're right
[9:25:58 AM] Lyveriana: Hah, well hey
[9:26:02 AM] Lyveriana: should it come to that, yes
[9:26:11 AM] Lyveriana: But.. Also. If Anora knows.. And plans to do anything with it
[9:26:16 AM] Lyveriana: I doubt she'd go and waltz over to Burmie first
[9:26:18 AM] drone91: precisely
[9:26:23 AM] Lyveriana: LIke
[9:26:33 AM] Lyveriana: 'oi! I know yyour depest darkest secrets and I'll use them gainst you now."
[9:26:38 AM] Lyveriana: (Not true, but, again, exaggerating)
[9:26:43 AM] drone91: It'd be the stupidest thing ever, exceptt
[9:26:51 AM] drone91: See.
[9:27:20 AM] drone91: All that /Maddie/ knew, Burmice was still on her side, still working quietly against Bhael
[9:27:21 AM] drone91: Hell
[9:27:34 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[9:27:35 AM] drone91: she attempted to contact her a few tendays ago
[9:28:02 AM] drone91: that's the literal problem there. if Anora came in and tried to salvage pieces of that alliance. It /would/ make sense then to
[9:28:16 AM] drone91: except the problem is, with Maddie dead they have nothing more to offer
[9:28:49 AM] drone91: In terms of people, and in terms of payment
[9:29:08 AM] drone91: once again, that's not a scenario out of question
[9:29:23 AM] drone91: from Burmy's 4th wall ish perspective
[9:29:40 AM] Lyveriana: Anora literally just goes
[9:29:46 AM] Lyveriana:  ..Nope. I'm not doign so anyhow."
[9:29:46 AM] drone91: like, if Burmy read the thread, she'd suspect that might happen, given what she knows about Anora
[9:29:49 AM] Lyveriana: because
[9:29:52 AM] Lyveriana: how would she know such things
[9:30:01 AM] Lyveriana: It'd get supicious
[9:30:07 AM] drone91: yep
[9:30:19 AM] drone91: another fun fact
[9:30:22 AM] Lyveriana: See.. Don't use up your resources unless you hav eto
[9:30:28 AM] drone91: yep
[9:30:54 AM] drone91: I love how in OOC channel , Thia read that, and was like "Shit , why didn't Thia and Maddie meet"
[9:31:03 AM] drone91: of course, not being present at concurrent periods
[9:31:07 AM] drone91: but like
[9:31:07 AM] drone91: gods
[9:31:13 AM] Lyveriana: Yup
[9:31:17 AM] drone91: imagine how /that/ alliance would have dealt with things
[9:31:25 AM] Lyveriana: ...Yyup
[9:31:45 AM] drone91: Two ruthless schemers and a murder dog
[9:31:54 AM] Lyveriana: Hahaha yes
[9:31:56 AM] Lyveriana: ..oh my -god-
[9:31:59 AM] Lyveriana: it's
[9:32:06 AM] Lyveriana: that reminds me of an entirely different story
[9:32:13 AM] Lyveriana: So.. You know, mother's day. IN douch, we say Moederdag
[9:32:15 AM] Lyveriana: Which
[9:32:23 AM] Lyveriana: Someone said ti sounded like murderdog
[9:33:02 AM] drone91: hahahahh
[9:35:23 AM] Lyveriana: Also
[9:35:28 AM] Lyveriana: I'mma fiflde about on piano, but I"m here for talks
[9:36:01 AM] Lyveriana: See if I can ge something out of that song
[9:36:06 AM] Lyveriana: ANd wheter I want to do it on guitar or piano
[9:37:14 AM] drone91: Aanyhow. The birdly alliance became a thing on Tanatia's birthday.  Burmy brought some tiefling looking for residence to Maddie, one that was ...either a cleric or paladin, I don't recall.   Maddie persuaded her to move to Southwharf - very cheap housing with the tacit idea of boltering the defenses , then they talked, Murdayn expressed her distaste for that ... kind, to which Burmy went - well, what better use of such a person than to staff such a problematic district...
[9:37:41 AM] Lyveriana: Heh
[9:38:15 AM] drone91: and then Maddie started to break Burmy in about how there are noble residences, Burmy went lolnope... and then Maddie sort of hit it in with the bathhouse and whatnot, they hagggled about prices, and they finally agreed on a visit to determine, in a day or two
[9:39:14 AM] Lyveriana: And the worst is about htis whole Maddie thing
[9:39:19 AM] drone91: because it totally has a thermal stream. Anyhow, Burmy asked Maddie about why she's so distant... and managed to prod out the bit about Cauri and how Maddie intended to confront her and just knew what it'd end up being like
[9:39:22 AM] Lyveriana: ..Anora can't get drunk off her ass about it
[9:39:41 AM] drone91: because her suspicions she feels are true - there's no direct proof but dozens of little things
[9:40:01 AM] drone91: and Burmy effectively convinced her not to be stupid -why get an insignificant cultist
[9:40:07 AM] drone91: when she can  go for the whole cult.
[9:41:40 AM] drone91: Cauri is replaceable, unlike, well, the entire Ashmadai whatever, which I think Murdayn suspected then
[9:42:27 AM] drone91: Anyhow, the next time they met, Burmy had information
[9:43:18 AM] drone91: She witnessed Bhael and Garath having an argument at the bar, then Elenaur talking to both in turn
[9:43:21 AM] Lyveriana: Hmmm
[9:44:18 AM] drone91: First was Bhael's sob story about how he was forced together with Antryg, worked to undermine him , then got assassinated before his plans came to fruition
[9:46:39 AM] Lyveriana: Oooh
[9:47:40 AM] drone91: and mentioned Antryg's grimoires as some danger. Then of course, Elenaur set to Garath, drinking elsewhere, and listened to him tell a very different tale, with him a red wizard (Which Burmy was super suspicions on) and Bhael a literal devil who fled hell and abandoned his troops, and a lot of other stuff, saying among other things how he helped Antryg (IIRC) gather up the magic from dozens of wizards across Faerun they murdered for their secrets, and blah de blah , which Burmy believed little of, then his offhand mention of owing so much to a woman (that fit Cauri's description), Burmy knew that Cauri passed by him before and behaved amicably too
[9:48:07 AM] drone91: and he implored Elenaur to save Cauri and whatnot. Burmy got a bunch of the detail from Maddie, like about Harrowheart
[9:48:15 AM] drone91: and then went about how things don't make sense unless
[9:48:43 AM] drone91: and she went to ease in Maddie in her suspicion with the concept of a streea, from sava.
[9:50:29 AM] drone91: When one sacrifices a figure, anything, even a priestess, to allow her to claim the matron soon afterwards.  Because, Burmy went,  the violin was far, far too obvious. It didn't make sense, and neither did it for Bhael to sit by and have someone spill his secrets and plans - in fact Garath mentioned Bhael trying to corrupt Cauri into following Rya's course /with / Harrowheart
[9:51:36 AM] drone91: And she went, the only way she understands this is a play-act, aimed to get everyone to swallow the lure. The violin was an expensive piece to sacrifice... but with such an obvious source of taint gone ,they'd be sure to have Cauri back, while she'd stay a sleeper agent
[9:51:47 AM] drone91: to act , far in the future, at a time of Bhael's choosing
[9:56:16 AM] drone91: and Maddie went grim, about how it made entirely too much sense and Burmy ended up telling her the tale of her eye, about how he was a colleague and a lover that she had all kinds of plans and plots with... then he stabbed out her eye  in bed after, you know, in an attempt to kill her on behalf of someone else, and to push himself above.
[9:56:57 AM] drone91: and about how it taught her a lot about nature of things. And Maddie asked for a hug in her usual sort-of-seriousjoking way
[9:57:07 AM] drone91: and so they did.
[9:58:03 AM] drone91: Anyhow there was all kinds of blind avenues in there, trying to figure out Bhael's plans
[9:58:57 AM] drone91: At one point Jha was introduced - she tracked Cauri's movements with the violin when the thing with Garath's fake death happened
[9:59:28 AM] drone91: Burmy talked with will around that point, met with Maddie fairly furious and they sort of ended up agreeing on the fellow's methods and how he basically drives allies /towards/ Bhael
[9:59:42 AM] drone91: given what she learned that he's done to Cauri
[10:00:50 AM] drone91: at this point they started mentioning Helm's Hold, and Burmy said she might end up going even, posing as a mage for hire. This got shelved, but back then had been a thing. Maddie actually ended up there
[10:01:00 AM] drone91: Anyhow, there was the bit about Anora and Cauri's house and
[10:01:36 AM] drone91: Hm. I don't know about her inner thoughts and motives, but you can take it that when Burmy asked about Maddie's private conversations with Anora , twice
[10:02:03 AM] drone91: she reported truthfully, although kept it to strictly relevant things, and tried to paint it as very business- thing
[10:02:45 AM] drone91: Back early on, they wondered about the grimoires and wondered if Bhael desires lichdom
[10:03:07 AM] drone91: since as Burmy stated, making a good soulstone is basically the first step to a phylactery, and a massive one
[10:04:21 AM] drone91: at first they thought he might have them and is attempting to get them to focus resources on denying him something he doesn't need
[10:05:12 AM] drone91: Over time, the confidence in what Cauri is faltered - Burmy was disbelieving but Maddie seemed convinced she had gotten her to forsake evil or whatnot
[10:06:49 AM] drone91: there emerged the idea about how Bhael might even be /using/ Will as an unwitting tool, a reason why he has done nothing  - whenever prodded the man 's rash actions bring Bhael allies
[10:08:00 AM] drone91: Oh, Stasiana had been contracted to scry on Cauri , with focus provided by Maddie, but like, it was never used not to upset the ruse
[10:08:07 AM] drone91: speaking of that
[10:08:47 AM] drone91: Burmy firmly stood about how the whole thing with the sleeper agent should be told to noone unnecessarily, because they /rely/ on everyone acting to Cauri naturally
[10:09:01 AM] drone91: and such can only be achieved, genuinely,  if they don't know
[10:10:08 AM] drone91: anyhow, later on understanding began to emerge, with the information... oh yes. Burmy's knowledge at one point included the fact Bhael's next move sort of lingered on the siege endign and the orb being destroyed - she told Will to ..well. Not rush with it because he'd be doing his foe's work
[10:10:28 AM] drone91: she wasn't sure if she'd been heeded at all though
[10:11:24 AM] drone91: Another little tidbit that stands out in my mind - at one point, Maddie spoke about how she might have reservations about blackguards - it was at that point a semi tongue-in-cheek way of referring to Burmy and her old contacts in the Black Network
[10:12:15 AM] drone91: and they're stil preferrable to diabolists and whatnot - this was when they agreed on Valefar being pushed in to the militia
[10:12:56 AM] drone91: Burmy replied about how it is so as long as those honest people or how Maddie grouped herself don't forget those behind their victory
[10:12:59 AM] drone91: once it's achieved
[10:13:08 AM] drone91: I wish I had the real quotes
[10:13:45 AM] drone91: but, here comes the real meat ,towards the end.e
[10:14:10 AM] drone91: oh before that
[10:14:33 AM] drone91: at this point there was this thing about the dread protectors / deathbringers
[10:15:03 AM] drone91: Burmy brought five into the district, being ostensibly of use against the monsters from below
[10:15:22 AM] drone91: but like, their little personal army, the vanguard of one , should it come to open war
[10:16:03 AM] Lyveriana: So many notes
[10:16:09 AM] Lyveriana: I gell sorry for you
[10:16:25 AM] drone91: But yes. Here it comes. In the end, they realized that Bhael menas to use Cauri as his catspaw in Helm's Hold - Maddie told Burmy about the operation
[10:16:29 AM] Lyveriana: Thing is... I sorta feel like Hjorr needed a reason to leave
[10:16:31 AM] drone91: BTW.
[10:16:45 AM] drone91: Burmy heard from Malyras the siege broke
[10:17:04 AM] drone91: she sort of inferred what her and Cauri were up to, especially with Cauri being in such a hurry, I think
[10:17:14 AM] Lyveriana: Hah
[10:17:24 AM] drone91: she didn't know Anora would be involved. Just work at unusual time
[10:17:38 AM] drone91: and she went probing "is cauri there?" and .. you know
[10:17:42 AM] Lyveriana: Theyre just guarding the orb now
[10:17:49 AM] Lyveriana: Yyyup
[10:17:53 AM] drone91: yeah, it happened a few days ago
[10:17:59 AM] Lyveriana: Thouuuugh
[10:18:03 AM] drone91: but like it was enoug hto infer
[10:18:06 AM] Lyveriana: They were actually writing
[10:18:07 AM] drone91: that you know
[10:18:16 AM] drone91: at some point that has happened
[10:18:19 AM] drone91: and..ahh
[10:18:23 AM] drone91: *hah
[10:18:39 AM] drone91: and hm. I feel liek
[10:18:59 AM] drone91: Hjorr tried to return for a pinch then found things have gone too full of fuck for it
[10:19:14 AM] Lyveriana: Yyuupp
[10:19:16 AM] drone91: and sort of didn't know what else to do
[10:19:29 AM] Lyveriana: Yyup
[10:19:33 AM] Lyveriana: I like how
[10:19:52 AM] Lyveriana: You, Hjorr AND Cauri's player informed me to GO CHECK THE FORUMS
[10:19:54 AM] Lyveriana: Like
[10:20:02 AM] Lyveriana: I woke up and looked at my skype
[10:20:10 AM] Lyveriana: Quiiiiiiirks brow
[10:20:21 AM] drone91: like, that bit sounded genuine especially since when he asked for a soft retcon .. .then realized it wouldnt' work
[10:20:39 AM] Lyveriana: Which is... Ow
[10:20:48 AM] Lyveriana: But yeah
[10:20:52 AM] drone91: and then went down about an hour later
[10:21:09 AM] drone91: Like, the day before we talked about Maddie's move
[10:21:18 AM] Lyveriana: Then I was like "...K." And I checked the forums
[10:21:27 AM] Lyveriana: And I read the word dead
[10:21:28 AM] drone91: and I was going on about hwo Bhael still might salvage something of it
[10:21:29 AM] Lyveriana: And
[10:21:42 AM] Lyveriana: "FUCK"
[10:22:06 AM] drone91: by acting at most, that he tried to preserve order and honour of his company ,which is a fault ,but not the kind that treason or corruption would be
[10:22:21 AM] drone91: and like ,less than 24 hours later he goes
[10:22:30 AM] drone91: "I almost hope it doesn't work. It'd allow for a clear exit"
[10:22:48 AM] drone91: and "Eh, even i f it does, Maddie will get promoted to Helm's Hold and probably not show up much"
[10:23:00 AM] drone91: Like he genuinely plummeted
[10:23:08 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[10:23:30 AM] Lyveriana: I'm just veeery glad he involved Anora in it and NOT Cauri
[10:23:33 AM] Lyveriana: Or Jade
[10:24:00 AM] drone91: and I feel a bit  sad over it, but then, what else was there to do, given the way things took place,   it looked overwhelmingly like Maddie did try to set Burmy up
[10:24:05 AM] drone91: but I'll get there
[10:24:06 AM] Lyveriana: Reason? Because Anora knows what to do with the info and how to go about it
[10:24:20 AM] drone91: the others would too, to different extents
[10:24:20 AM] drone91: hmm
[10:24:28 AM] Lyveriana: Oh yeah!
[10:24:29 AM] drone91: I'm not sure Jade is an elf-friend
[10:24:38 AM] drone91: and that Cauri is nonevil in allignment
[10:24:41 AM] Lyveriana: But Cauri is baaaaaaaad
[10:24:51 AM] Lyveriana: Cauri is chaotic good
[10:24:56 AM] drone91: so I suspect neither would be able to read it
[10:25:02 AM] drone91: scratch that then
[10:25:17 AM] Lyveriana: Bbbbut yyeah
[10:25:22 AM] Lyveriana: I mean...
[10:25:23 AM] drone91: Remember, what I know about Cauri is what Burmy knows
[10:25:36 AM] drone91: Okay, let's finish this ,right?
[10:25:49 AM] Lyveriana: Of course it'd have been... You know
[10:25:56 AM] drone91: go on
[10:26:10 AM] Lyveriana: Awesome if others joined with it. Or had it
[10:26:22 AM] drone91: With what?
[10:26:26 AM] Lyveriana: Buuuuut I finally had the chance to write a forum post
[10:26:58 AM] Lyveriana: Bah. I mean, it would have been fiiine in my opinion if other characters received it
[10:27:03 AM] drone91: right
[10:27:05 AM] Lyveriana: Im just glad Anora has
[10:27:20 AM] drone91: well fine. Not like it'd be your palce to do anything
[10:27:24 AM] drone91: events /happen/
[10:27:29 AM] Lyveriana: I know!
[10:27:41 AM] Lyveriana: I never said sp
[10:27:45 AM] drone91: remember
[10:27:50 AM] drone91: I slept for three hours
[10:27:51 AM] Lyveriana: And didn't mean it... You know
[10:27:58 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[10:28:08 AM] drone91: Anyhow so
[10:28:11 AM] Lyveriana: Not in a negative way xD
[10:28:15 AM] Lyveriana: Right!
[10:28:18 AM] Lyveriana: So
[10:28:26 AM] drone91: In the end they realized the final bits, or so they thought
[10:28:43 AM] drone91: That Bhael was in league with Rhyannon, their consensus being he wants to dupe her
[10:29:52 AM] drone91: that he's dumped Malark Greycastle with dud weapons and stuff fro this reason, and that he'll have Cauri do /something / during the operation to allow Bhael to claim credit or whatnot, I can't recall if there was more detail to it
[10:30:00 AM] drone91: Burmy parlayed with the man before remember
[10:30:25 AM] drone91: This was corroborated by Burmy learning that it was Greycastle who led the foray that captured the orb in the first place, and he keeps it safe
[10:30:28 AM] drone91: So the plan.
[10:30:42 AM] drone91: Burmy would go and parlay with the man, Jha'ahira as her bodyguard
[10:30:48 AM] drone91: among others
[10:31:12 AM] drone91: If he's his own man... Burmy has all the circumstantial evidence to explain him that Bhael has dumped him. She however has a better offer
[10:31:34 AM] drone91: Greycastle gives them the orb, and then he, Burmy and Maddie will go to the enclave to testify
[10:32:32 AM] drone91: Bhael is rid of, greycastle retains his post, or at most, moves to be the military leader of Helm's Hold, what with peacetime policing offering plenty profit and whatnot
[10:32:51 AM] drone91: Burmy suggested painting the shit weapons supplied to the man as simple profiteering
[10:33:12 AM] drone91: Bhael sabotaging the safety of the Enclave, Helm's Hold and his own superior for a couple sacks of gold
[10:33:37 AM] drone91: because it's believable and disgusting and if he objected, the question would come "Well why did you then'
[10:33:46 AM] drone91: Now
[10:33:55 AM] drone91: if Malark was found to be corrupted, they had a plan B
[10:35:05 AM] drone91: Burmy would basically ask for cooperation and drive a bargain to supply information to their side - the idea to make the actual seizure of the artifact easier by distracting Black Dragon forces with some manner of a feint
[10:35:38 AM] drone91: To gain their trust, Burmy planned to pull off something involving the violin -they assumed Meep's inquisition was full of holes that Bhael's agents knew about
[10:36:03 AM] drone91: Burmy would somehow feed Meep's people the informatiion Harrowheart, the infernal violin , is in the townhouse
[10:36:44 AM] drone91: then, she'd inform Greycastle of the impending raid as a part of goodwill, citing her own agents among the clerks
[10:36:49 AM] drone91: If this goes through, she should gain their trust
[10:36:58 AM] drone91: if not... the enemy will be in a world of troubel
[10:37:46 AM] drone91: To make this yet more believable they staged a little split over salvage rights - and of course, what Burmy would ask Malark for in this case would be the administrator's post in Southwharf for Valefar
[10:38:10 AM] drone91: this you might remember was when Burmy sort of went meh with Maddie in public, or rather Anora might
[10:38:18 AM] drone91: and started being all sugary sweet to Bhael
[10:38:24 AM] drone91: Anyhow
[10:38:47 AM] drone91: There was at least one, last meeting
[10:39:11 AM] drone91: irate, worried looking Burmy chewed Maddie out for disappearing for days and not letting her know
[10:39:27 AM] Lyveriana: Okay
[10:39:30 AM] drone91: and showed her the letter from Greywolf Darksbane, kept in her metalclad diary
[10:39:51 AM] Lyveriana: Oh yay Anora has that too now. The knowledge
[10:40:04 AM] drone91: That was when Burmy went batshit, had a skeleton let Maddie in, wait, then walked through the door
[10:40:19 AM] drone91: explaining she didn't know whether it was a maddie or an impostor
[10:40:20 AM] Lyveriana: You said that yesh
[10:40:37 AM] drone91: Terrified about not seeing Tanatia for days, and her and worrying they might be dead
[10:40:44 AM] drone91: if Tanatia leaked the news
[10:41:37 AM] drone91: Burmy urged for prompt action about Helm's Hold because if it was to succeed, it'd have to be done /now/ before the plausibility of her cover breaks, was absolutely irate about how Will's people could have got them all dead
[10:41:50 AM] drone91: and Maddie was grim and agreed this had to be dealt with
[10:42:09 AM] Lyveriana: Hmmm
[10:42:33 AM] drone91: now, Burmy decided to pursue the letter and the poison, they've figured out the whole bullshti with Will dying is that, (for which Burmy was thankful) and you know
[10:42:54 AM] Lyveriana: Hmh
[10:42:57 AM] drone91: She had Maddie agree she'll get a token on Will from the empty townhouse
[10:43:24 AM] drone91: Grinning about the fact that she won't let herself be the one to take all action and then be "exposed " for doing it all because they're in it together
[10:43:44 AM] drone91: because Maddie decided that stopping WIll being a loose cannon was their priority
[10:43:59 AM] drone91: oh
[10:43:59 AM] drone91: OH
[10:44:29 AM] drone91: Maddie got told , was shortly before that about how Will all but told Tanatia there's going to be an asssassination attempt on Bhael , which happened
[10:44:40 AM] drone91: remember? This was before Will began to shit over her
[10:44:46 AM] Lyveriana: Hyyup
[10:45:08 AM] drone91: and they went on about how it's good he's "dead" now at least because Tanatia thought enough to warrant his arrest
[10:45:14 AM] drone91: should Bhael convince her to report
[10:45:26 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[10:45:54 AM] Lyveriana: Oh by the way
[10:45:58 AM] Lyveriana: I like how
[10:46:06 AM] drone91: and there were little meaningless tidbits like Burmy happy she pulled out Tezra's identity from her, another name that didn't make sense, from her eavesdropping , and a ton of details like that
[10:46:13 AM] Lyveriana: All Cauri's lovers have gone through the shitter
[10:46:19 AM] drone91: yyep
[10:46:24 AM] drone91: it's like she's bad luck incarnate
[10:46:31 AM] Lyveriana: Yyyyup
[10:46:51 AM] drone91: From this point on, I don't know
[10:46:53 AM] Lyveriana: That's why Anora doesn't do women
[10:47:24 AM] drone91: Oh
[10:47:59 AM] drone91: Maddie explained her absence as being urgent courtly matters... a lady's name in Waterdeep an important paladinly ((iirc)) member of the Lord's Alliance
[10:48:22 AM] drone91: another detail - Maddie's little summoned celestial that located the sharan artifact
[10:48:53 AM] Lyveriana: Oookay
[10:48:56 AM] drone91: another detail  - at one point, though it proved likely unfeasible, Burmy was entertaining the idea of /faking/ the Orb's destruction
[10:49:00 AM] drone91: letting Bhael make his move
[10:49:09 AM] drone91: /then/ uncovering it anew
[10:49:17 AM] drone91: Helm's Hold sufers once again
[10:49:26 AM] Lyveriana: ..wow
[10:49:28 AM] drone91: And Bhael is exposed as a blowhard
[10:49:39 AM] drone91: who claimed things he couldn't have done
[10:50:27 AM] drone91: The reason this was abandoned was really the discovery of Bhael and Rhyannon's alliance
[10:50:42 AM] drone91: Because before, Burmy reasoned that even if she realized, Rhyannon would go with the ruse
[10:50:51 AM] drone91: because it'd give her the greatest chance to seize it
[10:51:10 AM] drone91: Anyhow
[10:51:22 AM] drone91: I might even give you the name of the lady, i have my paper notes
[10:51:22 AM] drone91: but
[10:51:33 AM] drone91: What you might need Maddie's input from, maybe
[10:51:36 AM] drone91: if Hjorr bothers
[10:51:41 AM] drone91: After this last talk
[10:52:20 AM] drone91: Maddie didn't follow through with gathering the hair, and ignored summons for a meeting... then, avoided Burmy  on the first days of her return.
[10:52:46 AM] drone91: Make note that asides from a single request for information, whenever Burmy called for a meeting she had crucial findings in hand
[10:52:59 AM] drone91: That much Maddie would have in her head
[10:53:35 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[10:53:44 AM] drone91: so yes. On Burmy's side, the point when you had Anora mention that the ostrich passes her greetings was the point she had gone across the camps
[10:54:21 AM] drone91: oh
[10:54:21 AM] drone91: oh
[10:54:29 AM] drone91: it wasn't stated in its final form, IIRC
[10:54:31 AM] drone91: but
[10:54:42 AM] drone91: there was the floating idea of pinning the bit with the violin on Cauri
[10:54:48 AM] drone91: the reasoning being
[10:54:57 AM] drone91: spoiling Bhael's trust in her
[10:55:11 AM] drone91: because if she wouldn't be there, she won't be able to prove it wasn't her
[10:55:19 AM] drone91: but at the point, it was merely entertained
[10:55:21 AM] drone91: as a part of the plan B
[10:55:26 AM] Lyveriana: And... The lorestone does capture every memory of hers, right? Sortof...
[10:55:33 AM] Lyveriana: I mean
[10:55:38 AM] drone91: Not sure if every
[10:55:42 AM] Lyveriana: Yesh
[10:55:45 AM] drone91: I think it's more awilling recording
[10:55:46 AM] Lyveriana: Thats my issue
[10:55:59 AM] Lyveriana: Because im like
[10:56:00 AM] drone91: liek the typed entries
[10:56:06 AM] Lyveriana: Yeah
[10:56:18 AM] Lyveriana: I do feel like shes recorded that info though
[10:56:25 AM] drone91: probably
[10:56:27 AM] Lyveriana: Sounds like Maddie to me
[10:56:42 AM] drone91: so hm
[10:57:07 AM] drone91: if Anora remembers the odd bit with one guard at a fountain, and the other in inquistion office
[10:57:11 AM] drone91: citing a red-haired woman
[10:57:22 AM] drone91: and then knows about how meep told the two of them about being after an artifact
[10:57:31 AM] drone91: she ... i don't know. I think she'd infer it was Burmy's doing
[10:57:39 AM] drone91: Maddie never knew this was actually carried out
[10:57:56 AM] Lyveriana: Yyyuuuuuppp
[10:58:03 AM] drone91: Burmy kept it quiet
[10:58:17 AM] drone91: her own reasoning being she's /untrackable/ with it ,because it went perfectly
[10:58:23 AM] Lyveriana: It will give her one Hell of a reason to think about Burmy
[10:58:29 AM] drone91: and should she need t oclear her hands off fo it
[10:59:38 AM] drone91: So yes. As dubious as it is by now, Anora probably got a picture of Burmy's involvement even as the two of them spoke and Burmy was very..careful about Bhael (remember? After their first meeting with Tezra)
[11:00:14 AM] drone91: that at least at the time she was covertly and diligently wearing her little wings to spin webs around the man
[11:00:50 AM] Lyveriana: Mhm
[11:01:01 AM] drone91: In fact she /did/ tell Maddie about everythng to do with meeting Tezra, her suspicion she isn't human (not even a tiefling) and the stuff that worried her about the drow armour and her offhands about a tasty mage
[11:01:23 AM] Lyveriana: Oh
[11:01:28 AM] Lyveriana: Oooh
[11:01:32 AM] drone91: just saying because it's an offhand
[11:01:38 AM] Lyveriana: Yyup
[11:01:47 AM] drone91: Anora /was/ there, she's be able to match timelines
[11:01:56 AM] Lyveriana: Mhmh
[11:02:13 AM] drone91: like "hmm, this happened as we ...as I did that thing with my mirror  musical instrument"
[11:02:14 AM] Lyveriana: Anora connects things upto a point where she shouldn't
[11:02:31 AM] Lyveriana: It was a cymbal, yip.
[11:02:33 AM] drone91: so yeah
[11:02:49 AM] drone91: there's your infodump of the alliance that broke at the brink of victory
[11:03:01 AM] Lyveriana: Tthank you
[11:03:05 AM] drone91: and led both of its members to shit
[11:03:18 AM] Lyveriana: But... Crap. Just
[11:03:27 AM] drone91: One is chasing a dozen ends at once , afraid for her life
[11:03:34 AM] drone91: and the other is dead when she lacked just a couple inches
[11:03:38 AM] Lyveriana: Anora will have no space or time to cope
[11:03:45 AM] drone91: ones that Burmy would have been able to provide
[11:03:51 AM] drone91: as I told Hjorr in the post-mortem
[11:04:01 AM] Lyveriana: Mhm
[11:04:11 AM] drone91: which ...eh
[11:04:19 AM] Lyveriana: I just
[11:04:22 AM] drone91: This would make for a bloody good novel
[11:04:31 AM] Lyveriana: Yyyup
[11:04:33 AM] drone91: It reminds me of Best Served Cold
[11:04:49 AM] Lyveriana: I heard about that I thiink
[11:04:57 AM] drone91: There too.. .you had the saddest fraying of alliances over .. in the end , unfounded suspicions
[11:05:03 AM] drone91: Basically?
[11:05:11 AM] drone91: Abercrombie writes all the characters I wish I had written
[11:05:18 AM] Lyveriana: Everyone will get to cope - Anora won't allow herself to
[11:05:19 AM] drone91: XD
[11:05:39 AM] Lyveriana: Because
[11:05:40 AM] drone91: Yeah, Burmy's and Tanatia's sortie yesterday helped
[11:05:54 AM] Lyveriana: EVERY TIME SHE WANTS TO COPE
[11:06:01 AM] Lyveriana: People get in the goddamn way
[11:06:08 AM] Lyveriana: And then it's too late
[11:06:14 AM] drone91: wll
[11:06:19 AM] Lyveriana: To the point where she attempts to off herself
[11:06:30 AM] drone91: ...ow
[11:06:41 AM] Lyveriana: ...Wgich she has tried
[11:06:47 AM] Lyveriana: Multiple times
[11:06:52 AM] drone91: ...yeah
[11:07:01 AM] drone91: somehow I'm unsurprised
[11:07:18 AM] drone91: Hm
[11:07:24 AM] Lyveriana: Just go back to that degree of suffering
[11:07:34 AM] drone91: I think once Burmy learns about this
[11:07:35 AM] Lyveriana: In the uberlong post
[11:07:42 AM] Lyveriana: Yeah?
[11:08:02 AM] Lyveriana: Oh and Burmy has gotten her message too btw
[11:08:04 AM] drone91: I think she'll spend some time the day finding out WTF happened
[11:08:19 AM] Lyveriana: Then go get drunk
[11:08:26 AM] drone91: that's the thing
[11:08:33 AM] drone91: She /can't afford to/
[11:08:40 AM] Lyveriana: I know that feel!
[11:08:43 AM] Lyveriana: Or
[11:08:45 AM] Lyveriana: Anora does
[11:08:57 AM] drone91: Hell ,yesterday, after a pair of glasses, Alena had her drinking conjured ,albeit sweet, water
[11:09:05 AM] drone91: and Burmy sort of went along with ti
[11:09:12 AM] Lyveriana: Hmm
[11:09:17 AM] drone91: because...drunk Burmy would be a walking corpse
[11:09:22 AM] drone91: she suffered from it once
[11:09:25 AM] Lyveriana: Yyup
[11:09:27 AM] drone91: hmm
[11:09:47 AM] drone91: remember ?The attempt where muffins saved her life
[11:09:50 AM] Lyveriana: I just... Right now I feel as if Anora is where I would like her to be
[11:09:50 AM] drone91: except now it sn't funny
[11:10:04 AM] Lyveriana: Mhm
[11:10:07 AM] drone91: now it's terrifying
[11:10:13 AM] Lyveriana: Yup
[11:10:17 AM] drone91: and doubly so because getting drunk is how Burmy copes with a lot
[11:10:21 AM] Lyveriana: But... Yeah
[11:10:34 AM] drone91: Right
[11:10:39 AM] drone91: so before colleague comes
[11:10:52 AM] drone91: care to paste your whatever intro tidibit?
[11:11:01 AM] Lyveriana: Literally... Anora cannot even express sadness
[11:11:14 AM] Lyveriana: My whatever?
[11:11:18 AM] drone91: well
[11:11:24 AM] drone91: what Anora sent
[11:11:27 AM] drone91: rthat's now deluged in backlog
[11:11:28 AM] Lyveriana: Ohright
[11:11:35 AM] drone91: I've literally typed for three hours
[11:12:30 AM] Lyveriana: During the next day, those remotely close to cauri would get either a sending-type message, or hand-delivered slip of paper, requesting that they refrained from informing her about the Gurrai's late lover. It also stated Anora would reason for this later, and if they had any questions, they could discretely contact her about it. Not much effort would be taken into writing those messages, though the message would be more than clear.

"Do not let her know about Murdayn's fate before I will, my reasons will be stated later. It is of the utmost importance. My thanks.
[11:13:06 AM] drone91: how was it delivered?
[11:13:12 AM] drone91: oh
[11:13:16 AM] Lyveriana: Sending
[11:13:21 AM] drone91: also
[11:13:24 AM] drone91: how early would this be
[11:13:26 AM] Lyveriana: In Burmy's case
[11:13:30 AM] Lyveriana: Uh
[11:13:34 AM] drone91: remember. Burmy, yesterda.. since time still works
[11:13:34 AM] Lyveriana: Morning
[11:13:45 AM] Lyveriana: Eeeeaaarly
[11:13:46 AM] drone91: also went to sleep at the time she usually gets up.   In fact
[11:13:54 AM] drone91: given drow reverie for four hours
[11:14:04 AM] Lyveriana: Heh
[11:14:16 AM] drone91: normally she /really/ would have been getting up about one-two hours ago
[11:14:24 AM] Lyveriana: Mhm
[11:14:30 AM] drone91: but
[11:15:04 AM] drone91: so Sending or a sheet of paper? Because the first might arrive to a sleeping burmy
[11:15:09 AM] drone91: especially whispering wind
[11:15:56 AM] Lyveriana: Probably both tbf
[11:16:10 AM] Lyveriana: She doesnt take risks
[11:16:13 AM] Lyveriana: Also
[11:16:15 AM] Lyveriana: ont of her.

What that image depicted, she couldn't exactly recall. All she knew at that point, was that it was the beginning of a pain she had experienced too many times. Images started to flood her mind as she plunged to the ground, curling up instinctively. Each image twisting, tearing and shredding her heart into the tiniest pieces. Every image made the sting go deeper, the pain worse, until it felt as if she received so much of it that she could no longer bear it. But whether she could or couldn't, didn't seem to matter to the stone, as the imagery and knowledge kept coming in surges, makign her twitch and shiver with each new one. Everything hurt in the way only loss could do. Only in that most, horrible way. She begged for it to stop, but the stone kept going, the knowledge kept arriving anew, like there was no end to it. The bardess would be twitching helplessly by now, her breathing sharp, shallow and short. And then, the last image came. An image that was so tender, so sweet that it made her heart shatter completely.
[11:16:31 AM] drone91: yeah
[11:16:33 AM] drone91: I read it
[11:16:39 AM] drone91: there was a reason I told you it was an amazing post
[11:16:47 AM] Lyveriana: Mhm
[11:17:01 AM] Lyveriana: It wasn't all that good. But that pretty much describes
[11:17:13 AM] drone91: okay it's good compared to mine
[11:17:18 AM] Lyveriana: Actually not even. The zone of silence does
[11:17:36 AM] Lyveriana: If you wouldn't have that... Hoo boy
[11:17:44 AM] drone91: yeah
[11:19:02 AM] drone91: Okay, how exactly would the sending be worded
[11:19:09 AM] drone91: I might be being derpy
[11:19:34 AM] Lyveriana: It's of course specific for each person
[11:19:44 AM] drone91: of course
[11:19:46 AM] drone91: if I'm to react
[11:19:50 AM] drone91: I need Burmy's
[11:21:24 AM] Lyveriana: Anora's voice is curt as the sending comes her way. "Burmice. You have probably gotten word. But I do not want you to tell Cauri Murdayn's fate. My reasons will be stated if you wish. I am sorry."
[11:22:40 AM] Lyveriana: ((I can just imagine Anora like those call-center phones.))
[11:30:21 AM] drone91: The first few words of Burmice's response are mangled sounds impossible to comprehend even through magic. "Murdayn's fate....Vel'bol wun l'cressharl... Anora... what...what's going on? Goddess."
[11:30:37 AM] drone91: ((that drow phrase is iterally What in the webbed pits))
[11:31:27 AM] drone91: Burmy's brain is basically booting
[11:32:00 AM] Lyveriana: "...You mean you don't... I'll be over. Cauri is still asleep." The line cut itself off, and... Not much later at all, she knocked on the dooor.
[11:32:10 AM] Lyveriana: ((Anora doesn't give a shit.))
[11:32:51 AM] Lyveriana: ((Cauri -would- still be asleep.))
[11:32:56 AM] drone91: I know. I'm pointing out it'd be  possible to pick it out
[11:33:11 AM] Lyveriana: Haha yes
[11:33:33 AM] drone91: Very possible. Like i said, inarticulated words first, mixing in her mothertongue and whatnot
[11:33:46 AM] Lyveriana: Yyup
[11:33:53 AM] Lyveriana: Bbbbuuuut... Yeeep
[11:36:47 AM] Lyveriana: So yes. Anora is in front of her house now
[11:38:45 AM] drone91: It doesn't take long for the ritual to repeat itself. Anora, ushered in by what she now probably realizes is an undead creature, its creator believes, able to go toe to toe with Black Dragons' best, except this time, the drowess, bleary-eyed and worn, stands in the hallway in her soft, flowery nightwear, her staff in one hand and a cup of coffee in another. "Anora, for Goddess's sake. Come on and... what happened. Where happened?"
[11:47:21 AM] drone91: oh
[11:47:43 AM] drone91: the entirety of the quote I mentioned earlier, about slamming the door. it might be more meaningful
[11:47:50 AM] drone91:  //So this is how you look. My last day in Castleton. The weather could have been nicer, and the street could have stank less, but hey, at least I know I won't be missing much.// Rhalyf mused as he took off his hat at the sight of an elven passersby. Once he would have find the prospects ahead of him dreadful, but when you hit ninety, life doesn't get any better even for a half-elf, and as his father said, if they make you go, at least slam the door.
[11:49:25 AM] drone91: ((for reference this was a guy preparing to basically commit a terrorist act on par with blowing himself up))
[11:49:47 AM] drone91: ((Burning Mountain, in Akellon, could be /scary/))
[12:04:03 PM] Lyveriana: "...Sit down, yeah?" She asked. "And I know I'm telling you to do so in your own house. But just... Listen." She had, in the meantime, looked around the city. Not nuch, but then again, it hadn't taken much for Anora to hear the widespread runors the morning crowds gave out.
[12:04:13 PM] Lyveriana: ((To guve Burms enough time.))</p></body></html>
