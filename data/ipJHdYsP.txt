- Once signed in, the home page has a title "Anex TTT Moderator Application" and shows buttons that take you to different areas. Main button that anyone can use that takes you to the application part to answer questions.
- Highly configurable (text, title, colours, font, font size, background colour, questions, assigning steam ID's to become essentially staff on the page)
- People type !app or !modapp )this can be edited in a config) and it opens a window showing Anex TTT Moderator Application Menu, they can also open via a url linked with our nn.pe URL (UI themed to server).
- Have to sign in via steam ID.
- Questions with boxes below to answer, can see what they're typing.
- Anti-spam filter but configurable to set amount.
- I have full access to everything.
- I can assign STEAM ID's to become Head-Admins on the app, these people can edit only what owner has made available via a permissions page with tick box like list to grant/deny permission. (i.e setting status on apps, seeing certain areas of the addon.)
- Admin Panel to assign essentially commands to the Head-Admin rank.
- Staff ranks have icons next to their names, maybe names highlighted red for [Owner] and Green for [Head-Admin].
- Interview panel for accepted applications
- Application comments once an app has been declined the applicant and staff can comment/reply back and forth about the app. (Make it look clear of which comment if which, maybe separate comment boxes for staff compared to applicant, slightly different shading?)
- Once an app is accepted (the status turns green saying accepted, red if declined, yellow if waiting)
- Could have some form of message/notification page for applicants once their app has had it's status changed or a reply has been submitted.

Not too complicated but lots of nice small details to give it that clean cut, Anex TTT themed professional look.
Maybe a watermark or line in the far corner of the home page saying who it was made by and what server for, the relation between the both e.g "Created and Designed by Peter/Southpaw for Anex TTT" as it helps with the publicity.</p></body></html>
