<html><body><p>Immoral Aria: If this is stuff you've decided we did Icly without us knowing/consenting that's really not cool - that'sthe vibe i'm getting from all of this right now. As a heads up. Like, even going off of the information that we had gathered last time this isn't something that would've happened. I hope this is just me misunderstanding this. ))
Ryan H.: Sounds like you just got knocked out
Red brought the cadaver to the doctor, and that's the murder you were arrested for
Immoral Aria: None of us were in negative setting with her, Oric even ended things rather amicably between the group and red. That's why I'm super confused where this is coming from all of a sudden. ))
Rei's eidolon had revealed that it wasn't the body of the guild member that she had dragged out of the alley, as well. The gender didn't match. ))
Simon H. (GM): I was thinking of it from the information you got about her murdering someone, but I'm sorry if I misread the situation
Jai Kassari: (( it sounds like at some point we were ordered by our thieves guild boss to deal with her because she killed one of their guys))
Simon H. (GM): Yes, the idea was that she killed someone and you, along with William, wanted to find out who
I'm sorry if I was wrong. I was worried about that when creating this
Immoral Aria: I don't know the best way to put it, but I'm not really okay with having something like that having happened off screen; without any kind of input from me or my character in how this was orchestrated. He was very clearly trying to walk the tightrope in keeping things amicable between the group and both organizations. ))

Jai Kassari suggests heading to William since they don't seem to possess any other leads at this point.
Rei: ((Yeah I don't really like that I fell for a trap that I had no input in
Simon H. (GM): I'm not saying that you were trying to kill her, I'm just saying you were following her. As for springing the trap, I'm sorry that I made that assumption
Immoral Aria: I don't get why there's the implication that we'd be following her over this either; as I said - Rei's Eidolon had revealed the body was the wrong gender to be the Guild's person at the end of that session. ))
At that point, we had no real reason to disbelieve her statement that the Guild's member had jumped ship. ))</p></body></html>
