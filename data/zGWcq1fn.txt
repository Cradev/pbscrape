Welcome to the "official" x3 British Role Play community. As a community we aim to provide the most immersive experience without compromising fun and entertainment. We aim to involve fire, police and ambulance in every scenario that provided at the start of the session. each scenario is well planned and previous intelligence provided.

The process to become part of an emergency service's is relatively simple. You will be asked to play as a civilian after answering some simple questions at the beginning of a scenario. This is just so we as a community can assess if you have the potential to become a true role player. if not, don't worry, we will still give you a chance. Depending on how well you role play within your first session depends on if we think you have what it takes to take up the role of an emergency service personal.</p></body></html>
