<html><body><p># 1. Create a Python function that gets an integer between 1 - 12 (as an hour) and returns the exact time in hours
#    and minutes at which the hands of the clock overlap at this hour
#   (for example, for 1, the result will be close to 1:06)
# 2. create a unit test for this function, using 'assert', or the Python 'unittest' framework
# 3. [BONUS]
#    a. add also seconds calculation to the return value of the function.
#    b. calculate the angle of the hands in 360 degrees system
#       taking 12:00 (noon, midnight) as a point of reference
# ATTENTION: You do not need to import any modules to implement this task
